Introduction:

In this lab we were to create a DB and load data from external csv file using JAVA JDBC API and Java simple methods. Along  with that we were supposed to search records using latitude and longitude or via city name.


Working:
First of all create table using SQL syntax in Java and then read csv file which is given in lab and parse it using "," and insert each record using Insert statement of SQL in Java. After all that you have to find the city by given latitude and longitude. Along with that you can find lat or longitude by providing city name.
 


How to Run:
Just run the file.
Wait for a while so that records can be inserted in the database.
Then provide the info.
